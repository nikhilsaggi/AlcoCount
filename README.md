AlcoCount allows you to keep track of the number of drinks you have. Each time you tap the screen, the counter will increase by 1. In the case that you make a mistake, you can always tap the undo button. The different colors of the wave correspond to the different levels, so each color represents a different BAC. This way, the user has a visual representation of their “drunkenness.” AlcoCount also allows you to input your personal information (i.e. age, gender, weight). We take these factors into account when calculating your BAC based on the number of shots you have taken. Overall, AlcoCount strives for an elegant, simple and efficient solution to the problem of overdrinking.

This app uses Autolayout functions to arrange the components of each display in a clean and straightforward display. A collection view is also provided of BAC levels corresponding to color indicators to help the user track their BAC level real-time. The app has four displays in total: the personal details tab, the drink count tab, the aforementioned BAC level tab, and the Yo Notification tab. All tabs are navigable via a tab bar provided at the bottom of the screen. The Yo Notification tab is integrated with social media app Yo and automatically sends users a Yo upon reaching the "Very Drunk" BAC threshold.
